How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by keeping them involved in the process. I implement them by breaking the tasks into workable parts to solve the problems given. Creating users stories breaks problem into parts that have a personality and reason for being solved.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I appraoch developing programs with an open mind. I write donw the requirements then break the program into parts that I can build and test as I complete them. I hope to incorporate more communication into my future devleopment work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member is to be dependable. I can complete tasks on time or be honest with my team on how long I will need to complete a task. 

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. The Client wanted to display high definition media to users on multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
By briefly explaining what is happening at key points in the program a person may follow the code without getting lost in the code.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped me learn about the different technologies involved in distributing applications from a client. I learned the pros and cons of several systems including IOS, Linux and Android. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to work on one part of the documents, I would choose Security. Learning the Restful client API took time away from experimenting with the security that could be implemented with the technology.  I would implement a more secure system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs as best I could the clients’ needs were simple but also vague. In a real-world scenario, there would be several user stories that we would prioritize and implement to best ensure the best interests of our client and user. Ultimately a user is more inclined to use a product they enjoy or gain value from.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would spend more time on understanding the technologies the code interacts with. As mentioned earlier Rest Application Programming Interface was used but I would like more time to work with its capabilities.
